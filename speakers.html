				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "Anatomy of an Open Source Release"</u></p>
				<p>There's a lot more that goes into releasing a version of an Open Source project than you may think. It's not just a question of making the source code available, because for most Open Source projects, the code is always available via github, launchpad, or other repository. First you tag the release, which lets people grab the code for that release. But people also want binaries and packages because not every user is willing or knows how to compile software, and if your piece of software is complex, then even if they do have some "./configure; make; sudo make install;" experience they may run into trouble</p>
				<p>In this talk I will take users through the process we follow for every MariaDB release, from tagging the code, to building it for multiple architectures and operating systems, to testing the packages, to signing the packages, to uploading the files to our network of mirrors and making it available to download.</p>
				<p>The goal of this talk is to give users an appreciation for the work that goes into getting the software they love into their hands.</p>

				<p>MySQL's EXPLAIN command has for a long time been a very useful tool in for understanding how MySQL will execute a query. However, many users find it a bit confusing and difficult to understand. MySQL 5.6 will come with several new additions that both will make it easier to understand the query plans, and provide more detailed information about what query plan was selected and why.</p>
				<p>One of the new features that will be presented in this session, is a new variant of EXPLAIN that provides a structured presentation of the query plan in JSON format. We will give several examples of how the new structured output will make it easier to understand MySQL's query plans.</p>
				<p>While MySQL so far has only supported EXPLAIN for SELECT statements, MySQL 5.6 will also support EXPLAIN for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements. This presentation will give insight into how one can take advantage of this new feature</p>
				<p>Finally, we will give an introduction to MySQL Optimizer Tracing. This is an advanced tool that will not only present what query plan has been selected by the query optimizer, but also give information about why this particular query plan was selected.</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "PROTECT THIS HOUSE | UNCC Takes the Crown"</u></p>
				<p>This talk will cover accounts from UNC Charlotte's recent performance at the South-Eastern Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition in Kennesaw, GA where they dominated 9 other schools taking away not only 1st Place, but Best in Defense and Best in Services as well. This win was a qualifier for the National CCDC competition which took place in San Antonio, TX.</p>
				<p>Linux, specifically the Linux servers are a crucial part of the competition and must be constantly monitored and must be secured as best as we can without all the tools we would need.</p>
				<p>Essentially, the competition is setup as 10 identical IT companies (one per school) who must maintain services that are already running. The computers, servers, and network are plagued with malware, misconfigured, contain physical security threats, and are wide-open to hackers as well. The team must reconfigure, patch, secure, and keep their network up while responding an overwhelming amount of business requests such as change control logs, changes in physical network components, adding/removing services, and much more. All of this while being attacked by a red team consisting of some of the best penetration testers in the world (Lares, SPAWAR, and U.S. Army USCOM). Scoring is based on three categories: Business requests/injection performance, defense from red team, and service uptime.</p>
				<p>The team is comprised of 8 individuals from the 49th Security Division, UNC Charlotte's ethical hacking and computer security club – also a 2012 nominee of Student Organization of the Year. Talk will include complete overview of the competition, including challenges they faced maintaining services while being attacked by a world-class red-team, exploits used against them, mitigation/recovery, and what it takes to be a successful collegiate computer security team, and how to use Linux to leverage a team to a winning victory. Talk will feature Zachary Mayo (Vice-President, 49SD; Co-Captain CCDC team) and Luke Snyder (Linux Admin, CCDC team, 49SD member.</p>

				<p>Cloud is perhaps one of the most talked about an over-used buzzword in IT today – leading to a lot of confusion and dilution of the term. This talk will give a brief overview of the types of cloud deployment models (public, private, and hybrid) and a general understanding of generic cloud service offerings (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS). The bulk of the conversation will focus on the open source software and standards to adhere to for building cloud computing environments and the complementary open source management tools that can be combined to automate the management of them. The discussion will appeal to anyone who has a good grasp of traditional data center infrastructure but is struggling with the benefits and migration path to a cloud computing environment. Systems administrators and IT generalists will leave the discussion with a general overview of the options for building and managing their own cloud computing environments using free and open source software.</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "Shared Resources for Promoting Innovation: What You Can Do Regarding Software Patents"</u></p>
				<p>Innovation, cooperation and the sharing of ideas are fundamental to the success of the free software community. As several notable lawsuits came to light throughout 2011, the free and open source software community saw aggressive use of patents to restrict choice and unfairly impair market forces. We'll see how the US patent system got to where it is in relation to software in particular and discuss what's already been tried and what's currently being done to protect free operating systems.  Have you ever wondered what's at stake, how much money is changing hands, who is at risk and what can help? Defensive patent pools leverage the patents of a few to ensure protection for the group against patent trolls and other aggressors. The core benefit for participants in these pools derives from the fact that a company or member may invest a modest amount but will still receive access to and protection from a vast portfolio. Free software developers are different and have a need for a very different type of defensive patent pool. Lastly, we'll see how shared preemptive resources like Prior Art and Defensive Publications can help defend Linux, GNU and related projects.</p>
				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "We Are Legion:  Or At Least We Should Be"</u></p>
				<p>"Software as a service" platforms enable us to carry around small devices and access huge volumes of information. At the same time, it presents challenges for collective privacy, a full diversity of viewpoints and customized online identities. Large service providers are less responsive to users until a significant percentage of their users are all clamoring for the same type of change. What are the options for customizing your web interactions without mobilizing an entire user community? Decentralized or federated services are gaining popularity as the answer for users concerned about the one-size-fits-all web. Decentralized web services allow us to create a many-to-many web instead of a one-to-many web. Projects like the Status.net code that runs identi.ca is a prime working example of how federated services allow users of different services to seamlessly talk to each other. Once standards were put in place users of different email and chat host were able to interact without any special configuration. More work on federation will allow smaller hosts of many different services to interact easily with each other. Media Goblin is just one of the new services that can help build more robust, decentralized web.  I'll discuss historical monopolies that inform the present situation and compare some of the recent problems incurred by limited choices for web services. There is significant work to be done on both the technical and social aspects of federation. I'll conclude with a survey of current alternatives, near to ready projects and the ones we might want to start thinking about building.</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "Forecasting MySQL Scalability and Performance from TCP Traffic"</u></p>
				<p>TCP network traffic is a good lightweight way to analyze and model system performance and scalability. This talk demonstrates a variety of performance and scalability analysis techniques on a single sample of TCP packet headers from a production database. No packet payload is necessary; the analysis relies exclusively on correlating inbound and outbound packets and their arrival times. This makes it practical to gather data from nearly any system with a call-and-response TCP protocol, such as the MySQL protocol (which this talk will focus on). Packet headers are not regarded as privileged data in most organizations, which helps avoid red tape.</p>
				<p>The talk demonstrates two techniques: time-series analysis of the data to determine whether there are performance problems or opportunities in the server's behavior, and using the data as input to Neil Gunther's Universal Scalability Law to forecast both scalability and performance at load levels beyond what is measured. Both techniques are accomplished with readily-available open-source tools, including some authored by the presenter. The emphasis is on achieving practical results, not on deep mathematical explanations. The techniques demonstrated can help practitioners assess a server without great expenditures of time and effort.</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "A Visual Approach to Drupal's Lego Blocks: Page Manager and Panels"</u></p>
				<p>The process of building Drupal websites has been compared to playing with Legos building blocks and it's no wonder. Drupal's core architecture uses a building block approach, with each part locked tightly to the other.</p>
				<p>There are a set of contributed modules, though, that take this analogy further. Page Manager, a part of Chaos Tools Suite, and Panels, which provides numerous options for content and form presentation, allow a Drupal site builder to assemble complex layouts and content configurations without needing any custom code or advanced theming experience.</p>
				<p>This session is designed to help beginner and intermediate developers explore the many options Page Manager and Panels provide, especially when used with Views. </p>

And what if you could do that in a secure server that was optimized for speed?</p>
				<p>Sound too good to be true? Well wait, there's more! What if I told you the way to do this was so simple you could almost call it System Administration for Dummies?</p>
				<p>And if that wasn't crazy enough, would you believe you can set up a development environment on your computer that mirrors the server setup?<p>
				<p>Seriously, I'm not over-selling this. This magical world of hosting your sites is not only possible, it is done the "Drupal Way!"</p>
				<p>In this sesssion you will learn how to use the Barracuda and Octopus projects to install the Aegir hosting system (BOA). Together they turn a plain vanilla Linux server into an effiecient hosting environment running Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP-FPM, the champions of server speed. The setup and configuration also locks down your server so you don't have to constantly worry about security. </p>
				<p>Then as a bonus, you'll learn about a project that provides an identical setup as a development environment that runs as a VirtualBox machine on your Mac or Windows PC.</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "The Pop Culture Guide to Open Source"</u></p>
				<p>"Open source" means something larger than sharing code. It's a culture and a set of principles, all built on a foundation of openness. But newcomers to open source sometimes have trouble envisioning what that means or how it works. And experienced veterans of open source communities often have trouble explaining the benefits of openness. Both can win from the common language of pop culture.</p>
				<p>For example, what better example to explain rapid prototyping than Iron Man? When forced to build weaponry, he instead solved his own problem (or in open source parlance, "scratched his own itch") by building the first Iron Man suit. Later he was able to build upon that and make subsequent iterations. In addition, the suit was copied by others – even enemies.</p>
				<p>The benefits of community and collaboration and the effects of a successful network of contributors are easy to find in any worthwhile ensemble cast, whether it's the Justice League or the "Scoobies" of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Mapping the relationships of the movie Love Actually demonstrates the connections between people that are sometimes less seen and the greater whole of crossed paths in multiple communities.</p>
				<p>The principles that make open source work for software development, like transparency, community, and meritocracy, can be applied to make just about any project, business, or organization better. But the first step in encouraging people to apply those principles is to help them understand them. Further, those already in open source communities are the first step to spreading openness beyond software. Because they've seen the benefits firsthand, they are the perfect ambassadors of openness. Pop culture gives both the language to get started.</p>
				<p>And once we've all embraced openness, it might even save us from the zombie apocalypse</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "Unified, Scale-out Storage for the Cloud"</u></p>
				<p>GlusterFS is an open source scale-out NAS solution. The software is a powerful and flexible solution that simplifies the task of managing unstructured file data whether you have a few terabytes of storage or multiple petabytes. It?s no secret that unstructured data is growing like crazy, Gluster provides a solutions that scales capacity and performance as you need it and is an ideal fit for an IT environment that is increasingly virtualized and moving to the cloud.</p>
				<p>There are two key ways that GlusterFS is beneficial for cloud builders:<br/>
				1. Storage layer for VMs. If you're deploying Xen or KVM VMs on a private cloud, storing them on GlusterFS gives you the ability to migrate to different hypervisors, suspend and resume quickly - even on another hypervisor, scale out far beyond what other filesystems will allow, and utilize N-way replication for DR and HA<br/>
				2. Unified storage layer for applications. With GlusterFS 3.3, you will be able to access your application data stores from an object (S3, Swift-style) interface, as well as a traditional POSIX-compatible NAS interface. This unified approach gives developers and admins the ability to access the same data store using a variety of different methods.</p>
				<p>In this session, attendees will learn steps for deployment and some common use cases.</p>

				<p>Title: Senior Technical Consultant, Acquia</p>
				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "Performance for Site Builders"</u></p>
				<p>Most "performance" presentations are designed for those developers that straddle the line between coder and sysadmin. In reality many Drupal sites are built completely from the administrative interface by non-coders, non-sysadmins - we call "site builders." This unique role is often overlooked during in-depth, technical presentations and relegated to "Module XYZ 101" sessions.</p>
				<p>This presentation is designed to give site builders the knowledge and tools to built high-performance web sites without even touching PHP or the command-line. The Drupal community is ripe with ready-built modules and best practices that can significantly improve the performance of any Drupal site. Use the rapid site building modules to get your site up and running, then learn how to cut those page load times!</p>
				<p>In this session you will learn how to:<br/>
				- Apply general best practices to your development process.<br/>
				- Tune the most common slow-performing modules (e.g. Views, Panels).<br/>
				- Evaluate the performance of modules before installing them.<br/>
				- Optimize a site's performance using additional modules.</p>
				<p>About Erik<br/>
				Erik Webb is a Senior Technical Consultant at Acquia, where has has worked since early 2010. Building on his many years of experience with Drupal, enterprise PHP application development, and Red Hat systems architecture, he has worked with many of the largest Drupal users in the world, focusing on high performance and infrastructure. On his weekends away from Drupal, he spends his time finding that next great adventure with his wife, including flying thousands of feet above the ground, paragliding in the southeastern United States and all over the world. He lives and works out of Atlanta, GA (or wherever that next great Drupal project may be!).</p>

				<p>Title: InnoDB Developer, SyBase</p>
				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "NoSQL with MySQL - Best of Both Worlds"</u></p>
				<p>The ever increasing performance demands of web-based services has generated significant interest in providing NoSQL access methods to MySQL – enabling users to maintain all of the advantages of their existing relational database infrastructure, while providing fast access to their data. This session discusses the existing NoSQL access methods for MySQL as well as the latest developments – NoSQL access for both the InnoDB and MySQL Cluster storage engines. See how you can get the best of both worlds – transactions, complex queries, high availability, scalability and simple, fast, flexible APIs.</p>
				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "How Does InnoDB Optimize For Performance"</u></p>
				<p>InnoDB is the default storage engine for MySQL. It has always been highly efficient, and includes many unique architectural elements to assure high performance and scalability. The InnoDB storage engine in MySQL 5.5 and MySQL 5.6 includes many new features that take better advantage of recent advances in operating systems and hardware platforms, and permit users to better control the use of some InnoDB internal subsystems to achieve the best performance. At this session, we will describe InnoDB performance features in depth.</p>

				<p><u>Presenting Topic: "Optimizing MySQL Configuration"</u></p>
				<p>MySQL's configuration file is often the focus of too much attention, and too much tweaking of variables that make no difference -- or worse, have the potential to negatively impact performance. The sample default configuration files that come with MySQL are unfortunately not very helpful or good, either. You'll learn a practical approach to generate a sensible configuration file that sets what's needed and omits what isn't. The result will be a more stable and performance server that's resistant to many common problems.</p>
