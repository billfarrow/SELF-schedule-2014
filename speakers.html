				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Anyone in Networking or Security who would like to be as ready for the modern Internet as the legacy IPv4 Internet!

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Welcome to IPv6"</u></p>
				<p>I am an Associate Director of Networking at UNC-Chapel Hill; my group manages Systems and Services. I have worked with UNC's Networking group since 1997 as the SNMP specialist.

Physics from Penn State in 1993 with "An Introduction to Scanning Tunneling Microscopes," and Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering from UNC in 2004 on "Network Service Management: Preparing the Internet for Telemedicine."</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Anyone who is new to IPv6, and curious. Anyone who would like to understand more about IPv6, and what's behind it. Anyone who wants to feel really ready for my IPv6 Security talk. Oh, and EVERYONE! since we should start using modern Internet addresses instead of allowing NAT to break everything clever.

This is probably my third choice for talk, after IPv6 Security and SNMP, but if you think it's useful to cover the IPv6 basics before getting into security, I'm always ready for that. :)

I will be leaving Hillsborough (about a 3 hour drive) on Friday morning. Looking at my schedule, I definitely can't leave before 8 AM (and even 8 AM would be a stretch), but I would be in Charlotte by afternoon (noon if I push through, 1 PM if I stop for lunch), so Friday is a possibility if that helps.</p>

				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This talk would appeal to anyone who has been handed the task of "make this RADIUS authentication work" and feels daunted by that. It's a gentle introduction to awesome software! For instance, I have made a Cisco VPN, several applications, Cisco router logins, Enterasys switch logins, and 802.1X wireless including eduroam logins work with FreeRADIUS. I've used kerberos, LDAP, and a few other back-ends.

Probably NOT broad appeal, though. That's OK, this is pretty low on my list of talks I'd like to give. Just pitching one of everything that I can do fairly well. :)</p>

				<p><strong>Title:</strong> Co-founder of Obsidian Security Services</p>
				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Puppy Linux Deconstructed"</u></p>
				<p>I first got introduced to Open Source Software by a friend, who gave me a machine in 94 with Slackware installed on it.  From that point on i was hooked.  Bounced around between the Slackware and OpenSuSe communitues before finally finding Puppy Linux. I became involved in the Puppy Linux Project in 2008, and have been a member of that community ever since. I've worked in IT most of my adult life, aside from a short stint in the USAF.  In 2011, I co-founded Obsidian Security Services, a small security consulting firm providing boutique services to business clients. In 2013, I joined the ranks of Jupiter Broadcasting as a producer for their shows focused on Linux.   </p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This talk may appeal to anyone who's ever used Puppy Linux, those who are interested in the methods to produce a modern Linux distro that will still operate on Pre 2000 hardware, or those who generally are interested in designing Linux systems outside of the status-quo.

				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This fun talk looks back at characters from the popular Buffy the Vampire Slayer series that went off the air 10 years ago.

</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Audience: General (community, educators, parents, students, open source enthusiasts)

This talk will cover how raising confident daughters with access to technology and mentors isn’t enough. By sharing her personal experience with raising a teenage daughter, Rikki will show how a high school programming class is a microcosm of the open source tech world, and how negative experiences early on are enough to turn girls away from pursuing tech careers later. Inspired by her daughter’s negative experience in her first programming class, Rikki will discuss what can (and does) go wrong in early computing education, and how the environment can be improved dramatically without affecting staffing or budgets.
    
The talk will also show specific examples of the overwhelming backlash that occurs when women and girls speak up about harassment. Attendees will take away practical ideas for improving technology education at home and in schools, with the achievable goal of creating a more inclusive, diverse tech field in the near future.</p>
