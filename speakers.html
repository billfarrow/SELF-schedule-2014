				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"MariaDB 10: Your MySQL alternative"</u></p>
				<p>In this talk we delve into the features that MariaDB 10.0 has, why you should consider it, how it compares to MySQL 5.6, and why you should consider migrating to it.

A quick overview of the topics include:
- replication improvements, including multi-source replication, Global Transaction ID (GTID), and more
- connecting MariaDB to a Cassandra cluster using CassandraSE
- using the CONNECT storage engine to join ODBC data sources with other tables and more
- using the built-in sharding features of the SPIDER storage engine
- improvements for DBAs around per-thread-memory-usage statistics, and more
- MySQL Enterprise features that exist in MariaDB: PAM Authentication plugin, threadpool, Audit plugin

The benefits are clear. We will delve a little into the roadmap of upcoming features, you will learn what features are ported from MySQL 5.6, and you will learn about the availability of a MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.0 release.

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Insane NoSQL speeds with MariaDB and HandlerSocket"</u></p>
				<p>There are two warring camps in the database world. On one side is the RDBMS crowd, these are the ones that care about things like the relational model, transactions, schemas, normalization, SQL and other such things. On the other side is the NoSQL crowd, these are the ones that care about simple schema-less key-value stores, insane speed, massive scalability, and so on. 

Both styles are useful in their own ways, but if you need both you've generally needed two different databases. But what if we could have both in a single database? 

HandlerSocket is a NoSQL-style interface for MariaDB. It enables us to read and write to a MariaDB database, bypassing the entire SQL layer of MariaDB which results in insane speed for the simple read, write, and update operations it supports. Of course, all of the traditional RDBMS features of MariaDB are still there when you need them.

As part of the talk, I will demonstrate live with code examples in Perl, Python, and Ruby.</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This talk will appeal to anyone who is currently using or considering using traditional SQL RDBMS and/or NoSQL databases for their business or website data storage and management needs. </p>

				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> MySQL Users</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Is Big Data like high school sex, lots of talk but little action?"</u></p>
				<p>The siren call to big data is loud in the computer press but what are people actually doing?  Most big data projects are like middle school science projects that are done for the sake of being done but providing minimal return on investment.  Your boss probably is pestering you to do some Big Data Thingie as that is what they are reading in their professional literature.  Heck we had key/value store back with the old Berkeley DB in the 1980s and don't ask your old man about visualization as he had that back with IBM 360s in the 1970's! But is there any good stuff in the hype?   So you before you sign the PO for a few thousand Hadoop servers or make a zillion vagrant copies of your environment,look at what is really being done and why you just may want to stay 'chaste' for the time being.</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Anyone being pestered by their bosses to have Big Data.</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"MySQL Queries -- Damned Lies and Best Guesses"</u></p>
				<p>The MySQL optimizer WANTS, DESIRES, and NEEDS to try to optimize every query it sees.  But how do you know it is making the best choices, how do you use EXPLAIN or VISUAL EXPLAIN to see what guesses it is making, and how do you make it pick the correct indexes?  This is a talk for those new or intimate with query tuning who want to learn when the optimizer is fibbing, want to make their queries faster, or want to find out why  the #%$# MySQL wants to read all the table when all you want is the top 10 items.</p>

Free Software's Welcoming Committee. She lives with her husband in Cambridge, Massachusetts -- surrounded by a community of food nerds and noisy musicians.</p>
				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Trolls Aren't the Only Threat Under the Bridge"</u></p>
				<p>Lots of small and medium free software projects are staffed by volunteers that don't have any money to tempt a patent aggression entity. There's been plenty of talk about patent trolls, but money isn't the only motive for a patent suit. Even if non-practicing entities are eventually curtailed, ill-intentioned practicing entities may not be affected. The free software community will still have to worry about anti-competitive suits, nuisance suits and suits designed to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt about the adoption of free software. So, what can we as free software builders, promoters and users do to protect the code we care about? 

Some solutions are only effective against non-practicing entities, while others may impact all kinds of bad actors. The strengths and weaknesses of proposed legislation, recent and ongoing campaigns and academic writings will be examined. If legislators and international trade negotiators won't take a stand against anti-competitive patent aggression, then we must do so as a community. Find out about some of the community solutions that are underway and how we can combat the threat of anti-FLOSS plaintiffs together. </p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Anyone who spends time thinking about how the patent landscape impacts free software.</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Non-Coders Wanted: How to Get and Keep Non-technical Volunteers"</u></p>
				<p>Many projects sorely need writers for documentation, press releases and blogging or experts on outreach, fundraising and volunteer management or a friendly pack of translators, but aren't sure how to get them. Non-coders do want to contribute to free software, but they need slightly different framing and like all contributors they thrive with the proper care and feeding. Tweaking your volunteer pitch, looking in different places, being open to different communications channels, and finding ways to appreciate folks will help immensely.   

Once you've got them, letting your new non-coding contributors get on with what they're good at will help them feel invested. In this talk, I'll discuss how to set parameters for non-coding tasks so that everyone is happy. With some basic benchmarks for scheduling, accountability and volunteer empowerment, you'll be able to retain and excite your new non-coding volunteers. Want more visibility, a better user experience, nicer materials or more well-organized events for your project or user group? Start bringing in folks with the skills and enthusiasm to make it happen! </p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Anyone who wants to learn how to attract non-coders to their code project for blogging, fundraising, translating and much, much more. </p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Linux Must-Haves: Programs I Can't Believe Aren't in the Default Distro Installation"</u></p>
				<p>This is a survey of various applications that the speaker finds so incredibly useful that they _must_ be installed immediately after a new machine has been commissioned.  These tools range from everyday use to development to administration to network diagnostics.  The speaker has compiled this list over his many years as a Network Engineer, System Administrator, and Software Developer.  Noobs will discover new programs and long-timers may encounter that little nugget that makes the whole conference worthwhile.  This talk has a lot of breadth, but not a lot of depth.</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Virtualization with Linux KVM"</u></p>
				<p>Are you interested in virtualization? Are you a Linux user? If you don't already know about the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine, you should.  KVM allows you to install and manage high performance FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows virtual machines on your Linux PC without any additional software.

In this talk we'll explore how to install KVM itself, how it works, and how to set up a new virtual machine step by step. It's (a lot) easier than you might think!  We'll also look at *why* you would want to virtualize instead of installing directly to hardware.</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Virtualization newbies can see how easy it is to get their feet wet with virtualization, and why they might want to virtualize instead of (or in addition to) installing operating systems on bare metal.

Veterans with experience on different hypervisors (Xen, VMWare, Virtualbox, Hyper-V) can learn about the tools and performance level KVM has to offer.

KVM veterans will probably still learn *something* - if not, they can heckle. =)</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"SQLite as an Application File Format"</u></p>
				<p>Many applications need to hold data on local persistent storage.  There are countless ways to do this:  Writing out one or more files of CSV or XML or JSON is a popular choice.  Some applications write many small files for a "pile-of-files" format.  Stuffing a pile-of-files into a ZIP archive is another common pick.  And, of course, some applications choose to grow their own custom formats.

In most cases, using a SQLite database file as the application file format is a better approach: more reliable, more performance, and easier to implement and maintain. This talk explains why SQLite database files make excellent application file formats and provides guidance to application designers on using SQLite in that role.</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This talk is geared toward software developers, application designers, and software system integrators.  Attendees will learn why SQLite often works better than other choices as an application file format.</p>

				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> Audience: General (community, educators, parents, students, open source enthusiasts)

This talk will cover how raising confident daughters with access to technology and mentors isn’t enough. By sharing her personal experience with raising a teenage daughter, Rikki will show how a high school programming class is a microcosm of the open source tech world, and how negative experiences early on are enough to turn girls away from pursuing tech careers later. Inspired by her daughter’s negative experience in her first programming class, Rikki will discuss what can (and does) go wrong in early computing education, and how the environment can be improved dramatically without affecting staffing or budgets.
    
The talk will also show specific examples of the overwhelming backlash that occurs when women and girls speak up about harassment. Attendees will take away practical ideas for improving technology education at home and in schools, with the achievable goal of creating a more inclusive, diverse tech field in the near future.</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Introduction to the Advanced Security Features of the Xen Project Hypervisor"</u></p>
				<p>The Xen Project team produces a mature, enterprise-grade virtualization technology featuring many advanced and unique security features.  For this reason, it's the hypervisor of choice for multiple security-sensitive government agencies.  However, while much of the security of Xen Project software is inherent in its design, many of the advanced security features, such as stub domains, driver domains, and Xen Security Modules (XSM), are not enabled by default.  This session will describe many of the advanced security features of the software which can be used in either a traditional virtualization environment or a cloud.</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This talk is for people who are interested in hypervisor security in either a standard virtualization or cloud environment.  Attendees will get an overview of several Xen Project security features, with pointers toward more detailed information.</p>

				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Geek Empowerment: The Real Heart of Open Source"</u></p>
				<p>Many people today have jobs creating Open Source software. But for too many of these people, FOSS development is just another coding job with just another development methodology. Although these people are creating Open Source software, they are missing the real heart of Open Source completely.

I was present in the late 1990s at many of the earliest Linux conferences. I clearly remember talking with many of the conferees; seeing the light in their eyes and hearing the enthusiasm in their voices. They weren’t excited about a new development methodology. Most weren’t even driven with enthusiasm by the Four Freedoms of Free Software. Almost all seem elated by their own empowerment—an empowerment which rarely existed before the rise of FOSS.

Until the 1990s, software engineers were mostly power tools in the hands of others. We could think up marvelous designs and concepts, but at the end of the day, some product manager had the last say on whether or not our bright idea would be implemented. We may have been the engine for IT, but someone else almost always did the driving.

The arrival of FOSS meant empowerment and self-realization of the geek. Not only could we dream big dreams, but no one could tell us not to implement those dreams. For once, what we did was our choice, and we could face the consequences of that choice.

But have the cultural changes associated with the corporate acceptance of FOSS actually killed the crucial self-enablement which helped birth the movement? Have the business people taken the reigns back again, costing us the important victory we won years ago? Can the next generation of FOSS coders experience the same empowerment that their predecessors enjoyed?

This session will analyze the past, examine the present, and provide guidance for the future of FOSS.
</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This talk has value for anyone in Open Source, from the rankest newbie to the most senior practitioner.  Newbies will learn about the heart of Open Source -- something you won't find in a job description.  And many old hands will be challenged to remember -- and teach -- why they started working with FOSS in the first place.</p>

</p>
				<p><strong>Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Xen Project 4.4: Features and Futures"</u></p>
				<p>The 4.4 release of Xen Project is no minor "point" release of software. This latest release from the original enterprise-ready Open Source hypervisor contains some important additions, including the enhanced libvirt support, additional support for the ARM architecture, the release of Mirage OS 1.0, a tech preview of nested virtualization, and more.

Another notable arrival is the new experimental PVH mode. Dubbed Paravirtualized Hardware mode, PVH represents a new leap in paravirtualization: Paravirtualization within a hardware container, resulting in potentially significant improvements in performance.
</p>
				<p><strong>Audience:</strong> This session is valuable both for current users of the Xen Project Hypervisor and for those who have not touched Xen Project software in years.  You will learn about the newest features and capabilities of the Xen Project Hypervisor.</p>

				<p><strong>Co-Presenting Topic:</strong><u>"Raspberry Pi Hacks"</u></p>
				<p>Tom Callaway and Ruth Suehle, authors of Raspberry Pi Hacks (O’Reilly, December 2013), will share hints and tips for brave hackers ready to bring their ideas to life with the Raspberry Pi. They’ll start with the important basics of doing tricks with your Pi and go on to talk about a few fun projects, from game emulators to low-Earth-orbit photography. This talk is fun for both experienced builders and novices who would like to get started building something with the Pi, so regardless of whether you know how to use a soldering iron or use a cross-compiler, you'll find something useful.

Ruth and Tom will start with the basic-but-important Pi tricks, like choosing the best distro for the job you intend to do as well as address more challenging problems, like what happens when you need to build a custom kernel. We'll tell you things like how to add a power switch (since the thing doesn't come with one!) and check your power problems.

Then we'll show you some of the cool stuff that we and other people have made, from controlling Christmas light displays and using the Pi as an FM radio to a project so awesome, it scored the creator an upgrade from girlfriend to wife. This Pi talk is topped with a generous meringue of Lego TARDIS, Pi-powered Pipboy, and aliens, so come ready to geek out, both Pi and otherwise.
